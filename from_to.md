# Legacy Prompt (Archived)

This file was kept as a reminder. The original Maverick prompt referenced
scripts, demos, and persona panes that no longer exist in this repository.

When you implement Plan 1 (Lead + Coder), write a new prompt that:
1. Describes how the two agents split the work.
2. Directs Codex to rely on `git worktree` branches.
3. Records decisions in `handoffs/inbox.md` and in logs under `logs/`.

Expanded prompts for Plan 2 can follow once the foundation is solid.
