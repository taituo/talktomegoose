# FastAPI Template

A barebones FastAPI project for Talk to Me Goose missions. Personas can clone
this template into a feature branch and extend it with real persistence,
authentication, and integrations.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn templates.fastapi.app.main:app --reload
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for interactive Swagger docs.

## Tests

This folder ships with a lightweight smoke script to confirm the scaffold
imports correctly. Treat it as the minimum barâ€”any mission work extending the
template must land with matching tests (unit, integration, or e2e) so Rooster
can certify coverage.

```bash
python templates/fastapi/tests/smoke.py
```

## Next Steps for Personas
- Replace the in-memory `_ITEMS` store with a repository (database, REST, etc.).
- Introduce Pydantic response schemas to decouple internal models.
- Wire telemetry or authentication handlers as separate routers under
  `templates/fastapi/app/`.
- Coordinate merge approvals through Maverick once CRUD behavior is complete.
